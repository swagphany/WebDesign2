<h2>Jewelry Business</h2>
<h3>"I own a local Business in Chattanooga"</h3>

<p>I am interested in making jewelry. I have my own local business called Fairy Findings. It is nature based handmade products. They are hypoallergenic. Everything is made completely from the ground up using natural items. I hve been making jewelry for about five years now. My business has grown a lot in the past year due to my supportive friends. I plan on selling at the Chattanooga Market this summer.</p>

<p>I started making jewelry a few years ago. I have always been an artist, but I had no clue jewelrymaking would be my passion. I started making jewelry to wear for myself. I would always get compliments on it from coworkers, so I decided to make them some too! This is where it all began. I started working in the repair shop at Jared Jewelry Company recently. I am an apprentice jeweler, I'm expanding my knowlege on jewelry making here.</p>
